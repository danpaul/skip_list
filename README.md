skip_list
=========

Implementation of C double-linked list and skip-list. Main program is simply a test of the data types (read the internal documentation if you're interested).  The double_linked_list and skip_list .h and .c files can be used autonomously in your program. The data type the lists holdsis set via a macro "DATA_TYPE" in the .h files.
